title: Archive Fever

> *"It is to burn with a passion. It is never to rest, interminably, from searching for the archive right where it slips away. It is to run after the archive, even if there's too much of it, right where something in it anarchives itself. It is to have a compulsive, repetitive, and nostalgic desire for the archive, an irrepressible desire to return to the origin, a homesickness, a nostalgia for the return to the most archaic place of absolute commencement."*

Deep research essays on the intersection of **AI systems**, **cognitive architectures**, and **human-machine interfaces**.

These are time-clustered explorations—snapshots of intellectual preoccupations that don't seek coherence but sometimes find it anyway.
