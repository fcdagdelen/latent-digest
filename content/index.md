# Latent Digest

Deep research essays on the intersection of **AI systems**, **cognitive architectures**, and **human-machine interfaces**.

Each digest is a **time-clustered collection** of deep research—not a coherent narrative, but a snapshot of intellectual preoccupations during a particular period. Some essays connect naturally; others sit alongside each other simply because they occupied the same temporal window of curiosity. The coherence isn't planned—it emerges (or doesn't) from whatever threads were being pulled that week.

Think of each digest as an archaeological layer: the topics reveal what questions were alive at that moment, even when those questions point in different directions.

## About

Latent Digest is a personal knowledge base and research publication. The "latent" refers to what lies beneath the surface—the hidden structures in language, cognition, and technical systems that these essays attempt to surface.
