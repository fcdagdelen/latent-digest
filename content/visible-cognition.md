# Visible cognition: when the process becomes the artifact

The emerging aesthetic of reasoning-forward interfaces represents a profound convergence: literary traditions that foreground thought's movement, philosophical forms that perform rather than report inquiry, and computational systems where the trace of reasoning becomes the primary experience rather than hidden machinery. **Text that appears word-by-word activates fundamentally different cognitive and affective registers than static text**—creating presence, anticipation, and the sensation of witnessing thought unfold. The central challenge these forms share is achieving closure without betraying their processual nature—producing what might be called "earned arrival" rather than arbitrary stopping.

This report synthesizes research across three interconnected domains: visible cognition as aesthetic experience, methodological pluralism and its interfaces, and the phenomenology of streaming text. The findings suggest that reasoning-forward design draws on centuries of technique for making thought visible, and that current AI interfaces have barely begun to explore the available design space.

## The literary architecture of processual thought

Stream-of-consciousness writing developed sophisticated techniques for making cognition visible long before digital interfaces existed. Virginia Woolf's signature semi-colons create "the slow drift of ideas and the transitions between thoughts"—measured pauses that mimic thought's rhythm. Her "moments of being" provide crystallization without resolution: sudden clarity that pierces the "cotton wool of daily life" without claiming to solve anything. The technique works because these moments honor the fundamental insight that consciousness doesn't conclude; it continues.

James Joyce's Penelope episode in *Ulysses* pushes further: approximately **22,000 words in eight mega-sentences**, deliberately lacking almost all punctuation. The final "Yes"—repeated nineteen times in the closing lines—creates closure through **rhythmic affirmation** rather than narrative resolution. Joyce described this as indicating "acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance." The word accumulates through repetition, building to a crescendo that feels inevitable because it's musical, not logical.

Thomas Bernhard's paragraph-length sentences create what critic Douglas Glover calls the "fugue stop"—the narrator becomes trapped in a verbal loop, obsessively repeating thoughts and phrases, apparently unable to stop, and then of course finally stops and continues. His novels achieve closure through **exhaustion and return**: after circling obsessively, the text arrives at a still point not because something has been resolved, but because the obsessive energy has temporarily spent itself at a meaningful image. *The Loser* ends with the narrator alone in a dead man's room, the Goldberg Variations still on the turntable—an image rather than resolution.

W.G. Sebald employs what Daniel Mendelsohn identifies as "ring composition"—elaborate digressions that meander away from the primary narrative but always circle back. His photographs function as what Sebald called "weirs" that "stem the flow" of time, creating irregular chronological dynamics. The embedded images interrupt reading and provide moments of material encounter within the continuous flow of prose.

### How processual forms achieve closure

These literary traditions reveal four primary techniques for earned arrival:

- **The epiphanic moment** (Woolf): crystallization without resolution; simultaneous arrival at multiple destinations
- **The affirmative cadence** (Joyce): musical/rhythmic completion independent of narrative logic
- **The image-as-rest** (Bernhard): exhaustion of obsessive energy leaving a meaningful still point
- **The completed circle** (Sebald): thematic return demonstrating we have always been where we end

The common principle: these endings substitute emotional or musical logic for narrative logic. Conventional closure would betray the process—an ending that declared "this is what it all meant" would contradict everything preceding it.

## Philosophy as performed inquiry

Certain philosophers discovered that fidelity to philosophical inquiry requires forms that remain unfinished, multiple, or self-consuming. Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations* consists of **693 numbered remarks** varying from one line to several paragraphs—deliberately fragmentary rather than systematic. He wrote in the Preface that this variation in style is "connected with the very nature of the investigation." The form embodies his rejection of the "craving for generality" he criticized in traditional philosophy.

The *Investigations* employs dialogical method through imaginary interlocutors who voice objections. The reader doesn't receive conclusions but enters into philosophical activity itself. As Wittgenstein instructs: "Don't think, but look!" The aphoristic remarks don't argue propositions so much as **display** how language actually functions.

Nietzsche pushed further. "I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them," he declared in *Twilight of the Idols*. "The will to a system is a lack of integrity." Each aphorism offers *a* view, not *the* view—the fractured form enacts his perspectival conviction that "there are no facts, only interpretations." Nietzsche wrote that "in books of aphorisms like mine there are plenty of forbidden, long things and chains of thoughts between and behind short aphorisms." The form requires active interpretation; the reader completes the work.

Derrida's *Glas* (1974) represents perhaps the most radical typographic experiment: two parallel columns—one reading Hegel, one meditating on Jean Genet—plus marginalia, superimpositions, dense parentheses, and typographical shifts that make **the page itself a site of argument**. As scholars have noted, "the spatial arrangement dramatizes conceptual betrayals and resonances, creating fissures where ordinary narrative closure would operate." The form doesn't illustrate deconstruction—it *is* deconstruction.

These philosophical traditions demonstrate that form can be argument. When Kierkegaard speaks through pseudonyms who represent distinct life-views, when Heidegger excavates etymology to recover forgotten meanings, when Derrida splits his page into columns—each performs thought rather than merely writing about it.

## Computational art discovers process as primary artifact

Digital and computational art developed parallel traditions for making process visible. Michael Joyce's *afternoon, a story* (1987)—the canonical first hypertext fiction— creates meaning through **navigation as aesthetic experience**. Its 539 lexias (text nodes) have no fixed beginning, middle, or end. Joyce explicitly addressed closure: "When the story no longer progresses, or when it cycles, or when you tire of the paths, the experience of reading it ends." Closure is reader-determined based on exhaustion, cycling, or satisfaction—making the reader's cognitive process the termination condition.

Shelley Jackson's *Patchwork Girl* (1995) uses fragmentation as both form and content. Readers "sew together" narrative from fragments, mirroring the monster's stitched body. The work declares: "If you want to see the whole, you will have to sew me together yourself." Reading becomes an act of reconstruction visible in the navigation structure itself.

### Codework makes syntax semantic

Mez Breeze created "mezangelle" in 1994—a "neologistic netwurked language" treating code as malleable poetic material. Hybrid words stack multiple meanings using programming syntax: "m[ez]ang.elle" simultaneously means "mangle," "angle," "angel," "elle." Mez describes mezangelle as "an interface rather than a language: a liminal zone between human and machine logics… a code that executes in multiple areas of your brain, not [just] your browser."

Alan Sondheim—who coined the term "codework"— created *The Internet Text*, an ongoing project since 1994 that is "a continuous meditation on cyberspace." His taxonomy distinguishes three forms: works using syntactical interplay of surface language, works where submerged code modifies surface, and works where submerged code is emergent content. The means of production is incorporated within the file itself.

### Live coding performs composition

The Algorave movement, coined by Alex McLean and Nick Collins in 2011, makes process visible through performance. Performers write and modify code on stage with screen projection; audiences see "keywords repeating and see them actually making something." The code IS the score, written in real-time, with errors, corrections, and iterations part of the performance.

Alex McLean articulates the aesthetic: "In essence, a pattern is where we perceive in the structure of an outcome, the structure of its making. In terms of live coded music, it's where we perceive code in the music, where we *hear* code." The TOPLAP collective's slogan—"Show us your screens"—encapsulates the transparency ethos.

### AI art surfaces generation

Contemporary AI artists increasingly treat process as primary. Refik Anadol's *Echoes of the Earth* (Serpentine Gallery, 2024) includes a **30-minute "data process wall"** explaining transformation from raw data to AI-generated video, showing arrays of source images used to train the model and making visible the "dreaming" moment when AI processes datasets.

Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst created "Spawn"—a singing neural network trained through public "training ceremonies" where audiences contribute vocals. The album *PROTO* (2019) makes AI training process audible: lo-fi, scratchy outputs included rather than polished results. "We wanted the people training Spawn to be visible, to be audible, to be named, to be compensated," Herndon explains. Failures become visible: "A lot of the sounds on the album make the process behind it very hearable… showing doubts and questions… poking around in the dark."

## Typography as cognitive infrastructure

Visual notation systems for marking cognitive transitions share fundamental features across domains: they externalize internal cognitive processes, create shared reference points for attention, and evolve through tension between standardization and expressivity.

### Literary section markers

The **dinkus** (∗ ∗ ∗)—three spaced asterisks—signals subsection breaks, scene transitions, or temporal shifts. Coined in the 1920s by Australian periodical *The Bulletin*, it became the dominant digital-era convention. The **asterism** (⁂)—three asterisks in triangular formation—emerged in 15th-16th century European printing, adapted from medieval manuscript marginalia. **Fleurons** (❦), or "printers' flowers," originated as stylized ornaments in the 16th century from Eastern arabesque patterns via Venice.

Different breaks signal different cognitive transitions: blank lines indicate minor shifts; dinkuses mark substantial scene changes; ornamental fleurons create more emphatic breaks. Brandon Taylor notes that asterisks "cue the reader that a transition is coming, a movement into something else."

### Mathematical symbols mark reasoning

Gottlob Frege's *Begriffsschrift* (1879) created the first fully formal symbolic logic system with two-dimensional notation using branching diagrams. His **turnstile** (⊢) marks provability—the assertion sign indicating that something has been demonstrated. Whitehead and Russell's *Principia Mathematica* (1910-1913) standardized notation that became foundational: ∼ for negation, ∨ for disjunction, ⊃ for implication.

The **QED symbol** (∎) marks completion of proof—a terminus that signals "what was to be demonstrated has been demonstrated." Mathematical typography developed an entire vocabulary for reasoning transitions: quantifiers signal scope, implication arrows mark conditional relationships, equivalence symbols mark identity of truth conditions.

### Esoteric glyphs as active agents

Alchemical symbols functioned as "steganographic and spagyric signs" representing chemical operations, zodiacal correspondences, and process stages in transmutation. John Dee's *Monas Hieroglyphica* (1564) presents a composite glyph incorporating Moon, Sun, Elements, and Aries—designed not merely to represent unity but to **work the necessary alchemical transformation upon its student** through meditative contemplation.

This conception—the symbol as active agent rather than passive representation—anticipates contemporary interface design where micro-interactions create feedback loops affecting user cognition.

### Digital adaptations

Contemporary interfaces adapt these traditions through:

- **Loading states**: Spinners, progress bars, skeleton screens (reducing perceived load time by **40%**)
- **Transition animations**: 200-500ms duration optimal; under 100ms imperceptible
- **Cursor states**: Arrow, hand, I-beam, wait—real-time feedback about system state
- **Micro-interactions**: Button states, toggle animations, validation feedback

The core principle persists: visual markers reduce cognitive load by creating shared reference points for attention, allowing the mind to recalibrate at transitions.

## Holding multiple methods in productive tension

The Mnemosyne Atlas represents one of the most sophisticated attempts to create meaning through juxtaposition without synthesis. Aby Warburg constructed **63 large panels** covered in black cloth, pinning approximately **971 photographs** in careful arrangements—but providing no explanatory text. His "iconology of intervals" generated meaning not through individual images but through **gaps and relationships between them**.

Key concepts included **Pathosformel** (pathos formula)—recurring gestural expressions of emotional intensity across centuries—and **Denkraum** (thought-space)—a dynamic conceptual space where images reveal how subjective and objective forces shape culture. The Atlas allowed spectators to experience for themselves the tensions between reason and unreason that riddle culture, rather than being told about them.

Warburg's method fundamentally resists textual explanation. He planned supplementary text volumes but never completed them. The balance of word and image is "decidedly tilted toward the latter." Images include heterogeneous sources: Renaissance paintings alongside newspaper clippings, advertisements, postage stamps. A zeppelin image juxtaposed with medieval sky maps; a golf player paired with Judith beheading Holofernes.

### Memory theaters distribute knowledge spatially

Frances Yates's *The Art of Memory* (1966) traces the classical mnemonic tradition: memorizing a building's spaces (loci), placing striking images at each location, traversing the memory building to recall information. Giulio Camillo's Memory Theater (1519-1544) reversed the relationship: a single spectator stands on stage, looking at the "audience" of knowledge distributed across **seven tiers × seven columns = 49 places**, each marked with symbolic images from mythology, Kabbalah, and hermeticism.

The theater aimed to contain "all human concepts, everything which exists in the whole world." Multiple symbolic systems coexist in the grid without hierarchical ordering. Viglius wrote to Erasmus in 1532: "They say that this man has constructed a certain amphitheatre… into which whoever is admitted as a spectator will be able to discourse on any subject no less fluently than Cicero."

### Oulipo: constraints that enable

Raymond Queneau famously described Oulipians as "rats who construct the labyrinth from which they then try to escape." The group's techniques—lipograms (excluding letters), N+7 (replacing nouns with dictionary successors), snowballs (incremental growth)— demonstrate that **the more you limit yourself, the more your creativity grows**.

Georges Perec's *La Disparition* runs 300 pages without the letter "e." *Life: A User's Manual* uses a mathematical structure to generate narrative across 99 chapters. The constraints push writers into "uncharted territories," forcing novel word choices and conceptual connections. Oulipo opposes Surrealist automatism—constraints provide deliberate structure rather than chance.

## A library of reasoning methods

Research identified twelve distinct analytical methods from non-Western and practitioner traditions, each structuring reasoning differently:

**Non-Western philosophical traditions:**

1. **Islamic Falsafa (Demonstrative Reasoning)**: Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina's distinction between *taṣawwur* (conception) and *taṣdīq* (assertion); logic serving moral and religious certainty
1. **Madhyamaka Tetralemma**: Nāgārjuna's four-fold negation examines whether X is true, false, both, or neither—then negates all four to demonstrate emptiness of inherent existence
1. **Neo-Confucian Investigation of Things** (*gewu*): Systematic observation to discern *li* (pattern/principle) until breakthrough (*huoran guantong*)—sudden comprehensive understanding
1. **Two-Eyed Seeing** (*Etuaptmumk*): Mi'kmaw framework for "learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of Western ways of knowing, and to use both together"

**Practitioner traditions:**

1. **Design Thinking**: Five iterative phases (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test) prioritizing human needs over assumptions
1. **Clinical Reasoning**: Dual process model integrating fast intuitive pattern recognition with slow analytical hypothesis testing
1. **Legal Analysis (IRAC)**: Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion—the fundamental structure requiring explicit connection between rule and fact
1. **Talmudic Hermeneutics**: Rabbi Ishmael's 13 rules including *kal va-ḥomer* (a fortiori reasoning) and *gezerah shavah* (inference from similar phrases)

**Artistic/generative methods:**

1. **Oblique Strategies**: Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt's deck of prompts designed to break creative blocks through lateral disruption
1. **Cut-Up Technique**: William Burroughs' method of physically cutting and rearranging text to reveal "implicit content" impossible for single conscious mind
1. **Aleatoric Composition**: John Cage's use of I Ching hexagrams to determine musical parameters, surrendering intentional control
1. **Surrealist Techniques**: Automatic writing and exquisite corpse—bypassing rational control to access unconscious

These methods differ fundamentally from standard Western analytical reasoning by emphasizing relationality, collective knowledge, integration of intuition, productive constraint, surrender of control, and wisdom-orientation rather than purely descriptive purposes.

### The gap in AI method libraries

Current AI research lacks a general-purpose "method library" in the sense of catalogued reasoning frameworks that can be consciously selected and switched between. The closest approximations are:

- **ReasonFlux** (2025): ~500 structured thought templates for mathematical problems, with hierarchical reinforcement learning for template selection
- **Prompt engineering catalogs**: Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, tree-of-thoughts techniques applied ad hoc
- **Tool-use frameworks**: ReAct (thought-action-observation loops), ARTIST (agentic reasoning via RL)

This represents a significant opportunity: creating explicit method libraries that preserve productive tension between frameworks—inspired by Warburg's atlas, memory theaters, and Oulipian constraints—rather than collapsing into single unified approaches.

## The phenomenology of streaming text

Static text is *about* thought; streaming text *performs* thought. Research reveals that watching text appear word-by-word activates fundamentally different cognitive and affective registers than reading complete text.

### Temporal processing differs

Studies on dynamic text presentation found an optimal rate around **6 letters per second** regardless of text difficulty—below or above this rate, both readability and favorability decrease. Static text display generates the **lowest cognitive load**, followed by dynamic, then mixed types generating highest load. This suggests streaming text inherently demands more cognitive resources.

Word-by-word rendering allows readers time to review past text "to confirm existing mental models, instead of resolving comprehension difficulties." The pauses introduced by sequential rendering provide processing advantage. The cognitive science "landscape model" describes reading comprehension as involving "fluctuations in the activation of concepts as the reader proceeds through the text"— streaming makes this incremental building visible.

### Anticipation creates engagement

The psychological model of tension and suspense (Lehne & Koelsch, 2015) identifies key components: conflict, dissonance, or **uncertainty** triggers the experience; **future-directed processes** of expectation and prediction follow; **divergent affective outcomes** intensify when anticipated results range from highly positive to highly negative. Suspense activates the amygdala and adrenal glands while reward processing areas in the striatum engage.

Serialization research reveals that cliffhangers create dopamine surges "pushing us to continue"—viewers enter a flow state of "deep focus and narrative immersion." Binge-watching increases parasocial relationships and narrative transportation compared to weekly viewing. The gap between episodes has roots in 19th-century serialized novels—suspenseful endings designed to retain interest.

### The typing indicator creates presence

The typing awareness indicator was invented by Jerry Cuomo at IBM in the late 1990s. The first iteration showed characters in real-time, proving embarrassing; it evolved to the current animated three dots. The indicator creates what researchers call **"tyranny of the text bubble"** or **"chat app hell"**—exploiting the uncertainty principle in psychology where humans are uncomfortable with ambiguity.

Yet ACM research on live-typing indicators found they also made participants feel "connected, vulnerable, and have richer conversations." Participants reported: "It was like face-to-face communication because I could see them making mistakes" and "We were thinking together while not being together." The typing indicator creates **co-presence**—the sensation of another mind actively engaged.

### Terminal aesthetics reveal process

Terminal interfaces feel "authentic" and "powerful" because they reveal their guts:

> "There's a reason terminal interfaces still feel alive decades later. They respond instantly. They reveal their guts. **They show you process.** When you run a command and lines pour down the screen, you can feel time passing. The system breathes with you."

Contrast this with GUI abstraction: "a skeleton loader pretending to be progress, masking the fact that nothing is happening at all. Smoothness became a lie." Terminal aesthetics signal authenticity, craft, and "earned knowledge" while providing immediacy, transparency, temporality, and a sense of ritual ("Your aliases become spells. Your dotfiles become scripture.").

### What makes text feel like thinking

Linguistic research identifies markers of cognitive effort: **hedges** ("sort of," "about"), **plausibility shields** ("I think," "maybe"), and **attribution shields** ("According to…"). People produce more disfluencies, longer latencies, rising intonation, and expressions of doubt when they have low confidence.

Paradoxically, **decreased fluency can benefit cognitive processing**. One-hand typing (inducing disfluency) resulted in increased lexical sophistication—slowing down allows "more time for lexical processes to unfold." Writing is not simply expressing pre-existing thoughts: "It's the process through which ideas are produced and refined."

## The current landscape of reasoning-forward AI interfaces

Major AI systems have taken divergent approaches to reasoning visibility:

**Anthropic's Claude Extended Thinking** shows reasoning in an expandable section before the final answer. Users can set "thinking budget" (minimum 1,024 tokens, can exceed 32K). Claude 4 models return summarized thinking rather than raw traces. Some thinking blocks are encrypted/redacted when flagged by safety systems—users see "the rest of the thought process is not available" while encrypted content still influences output.

**OpenAI's reasoning models** (o1, o3, o4-mini) deliberately conceal chain-of-thought. "Reasoning tokens" consume context but are not visible via API—only token count is returned. OpenAI explicitly forbids users from trying to reveal reasoning, citing AI safety and competitive concerns. GPT-5.2 introduced a "slimmed-down view" with an "answer now" button to skip remaining reasoning.

**Perplexity AI** takes a citation-forward approach with inline numbered footnotes linking to expandable source snippets. Their "refusal-to-hallucinate" design won't generate answers without reputable sources. Pro Search shows step-by-step plan execution. Users proved more willing to wait when intermediate progress was displayed.

**Wolfram Alpha** pioneered step-by-step solutions—walking through at user's pace with optional hints, multiple solution methods, and intermediate steps within main steps. The approach has been "industry standard" for over 10 years.

### What works in reasoning interfaces

**Citations and source attribution** build trust through verifiability—users significantly more likely to rely on AI with visible sources. **Interactive manipulation** increases perceived control—the Hippo system (UIST 2025) found direct editing of reasoning steps significantly improved sense of control (M=5.75 vs 4.19 baseline) and awareness of assumptions (M=6.25 vs 4.69). **Progressive disclosure** through collapsible sections reduces cognitive load. **Hierarchical structure**—trees and graphs rather than linear text—helps users "quickly grasp key concepts."

### What fails

**Walls of unstructured text** create cognitive overload; users rarely engage meaningfully with linear chain-of-thought display. **Complete opacity** causes trust and troubleshooting concerns. **Excessive interaction requirements** backfire: "If the model needs to confirm with me so many times, I just felt that the model is not that good." **One-size-fits-all transparency** ignores that user preferences vary dramatically by task complexity and stakes.

### Unexplored opportunities

Several gaps remain in current reasoning-forward interfaces:

1. **Adaptive reasoning visibility**: No system dynamically adjusts transparency based on task complexity, user expertise, or stakes
1. **Breadth-first exploration**: Most systems use depth-first traversal; users often want "high-level themes first, then selective detail"
1. **Networked reasoning visualization**: Human reasoning involves complex networks of interconnected concepts; current interfaces are purely sequential
1. **Skip/summarize mid-stream**: No current system allows jumping to conclusion mid-generation when user "got the answer"
1. **Collaborative reasoning**: Current tools are solo experiences; team workflows remain unsupported
1. **Reasoning history/provenance**: No robust tracking of how reasoning influenced outputs over conversation
1. **User-personalized reasoning styles**: No systems learn individual engagement preferences
1. **Cross-modal visualization**: Visual chain-of-thought for multimodal reasoning emerging in research but not production
1. **Uncertainty quantification**: Per-claim confidence indicators within reasoning
1. **Alternative path exploration**: Showing reasoning branches AI considered but didn't take

## Closure without betrayal: synthesizing the research

The cross-cutting question—how processual forms achieve closure without betraying their nature—finds consistent answers across literary, philosophical, computational, and interface traditions:

**Emotional/musical logic substitutes for narrative logic.** Joyce's "Yes," Woolf's synchronized arrivals, Bernhard's image-rests, Sebald's thematic returns all function like musical codas. They provide satisfaction independent of logical resolution.

**The reader/user completes the work.** Gaps, fragments, and contradictions require interpretive participation. Hypertext fiction ends when paths cycle or the reader tires. Codework offers multiple valid readings. Interactive reasoning trees let users determine depth of engagement. Closure is achieved *by* the participant, not imposed *upon* them.

**Exhaustion as arrival.** Particularly in Bernhard, but also across computational forms, the text arrives at closure through spending—obsessive energy temporarily depleted, allowing momentary stillness. This mirrors actual cognitive experience: we don't resolve spiraling thoughts; we eventually tire and pause.

**Crystallization versus resolution.** Processual endings crystallize rather than resolve. They provide moments of clarity about the process itself—"I have had my vision"—without claiming to have solved any problem. The clarity IS the achievement: not an answer, but articulated experience.

The most sophisticated reasoning-forward interfaces will need to honor these principles: making the reasoning itself valuable (not just instrumental), allowing user-determined closure, providing crystallization moments without false resolution, and using rhythm and structure rather than conclusions to create the feeling of earned arrival.

The frontier lies in interfaces that treat reasoning traces not as debug output to be hidden or perfunctorily displayed, but as the primary aesthetic and intellectual artifact—where watching thought unfold becomes as meaningful as the conclusions it reaches.
